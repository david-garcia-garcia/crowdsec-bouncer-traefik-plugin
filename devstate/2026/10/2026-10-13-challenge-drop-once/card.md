## How this fits together
Ticket 2026-10-13-challenge-drop-once on branch 2026-10-13-challenge-drop-once targeting main; PR https://github.com/david-garcia-garcia/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/pull/195; CI not seen.

Upstream: https://github.com/maxlerebourg/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/pull/403 (fixes https://github.com/maxlerebourg/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/issues/402, point 5). This fork's `main` has not merged upstream #343, so `handleAppsecResponseServeHTTP` does not exist here; PR 403 point 5 skips the dropped increment on `/crowdsec-internal/challenge/*` in that function. We are not copying their patch.

| Does raw scenario ride a new `Decision.Scenario` field or another Put argument? | additive incidental — new field on `decisionstore.Decision`; existing `Decision{}` literals keep working (zero value is empty id 0); Unknowns lists the surface, no criterion names field vs extra argument | assumed — add `Scenario` on `decisionstore.Decision`. `streamPutItem` copies LAPI `item.Scenario`. Grow unexported `liveResult` with a scenario string so `memoLive` Puts it. Do not add a parallel Put argument. | explore |

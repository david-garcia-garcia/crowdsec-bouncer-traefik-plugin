## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Bouncer binds clients through atomic late bind
The per-router bouncer SHALL hold three optional bound clients as `atomic.Value` fields (LAPI, AppSec, and captcha), each able to hold a typed nil. Each field's stored concrete type SHALL stay `*reclaim.Box` (Yaegi). On every Watch publish into a bound field, the bouncer SHALL `Store` a new `*reclaim.Box{Value: …}` and MUST NOT assign `Box.Value` in place on a Box already published in that field. `ServeHTTP` SHALL `Load` those fields only and MUST NOT resolve instance names, Peek slot tables, or Open clients on the request path. Subscribers MUST NOT Bind reclaim on those clients. The bouncer SHALL read `lapiMode` from the loaded LAPI client on each request, not from a copy taken at `New`. When `bouncerEnabled` is false the handler SHALL call `next` without applying decisions while owners may still Open and publish.

#### Scenario: Nil LAPI client uses failure action for that leg
- **WHEN** the bouncer subscribed to LAPI but the loaded value is empty and `startupBlock` is false
- **THEN** the request uses that router's LAPI failure action for the LAPI leg
- **AND** no panic occurs

#### Scenario: Mode follows published client swap
- **WHEN** a subscriber's bound LAPI client changes from stream to live via Publish
- **THEN** the next request branches on the newly loaded client's mode

#### Scenario: Captcha binding is Load-only
- **WHEN** the bouncer subscribed to captcha
- **THEN** `ServeHTTP` Loads the captcha `atomic.Value` only
- **AND** it does not Open or reconstruct a captcha client on the request path

#### Scenario: Bind update publishes a new Box
- **WHEN** a Watch notice updates an already-bound LAPI, AppSec, or captcha field
- **THEN** the field's `atomic.Value` Stores a new `*reclaim.Box`
- **AND** the previous Box's `Value` field is not written in place
- **AND** concurrent ServeHTTP Unbox of that field does not panic from a torn `any`

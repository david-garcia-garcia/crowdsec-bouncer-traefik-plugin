## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: AppSec User-Agent includes plugin version
AppSec Query SHALL set the outbound `User-Agent` to `Crowdsec-Bouncer-Traefik-Plugin/` plus the plugin version passed into the AppSec Client. It MUST NOT leave that header empty when a version was passed.

#### Scenario: Query User-Agent matches constructed version
- **WHEN** an AppSec Client constructed with plugin version `v9.9.9-test` queries the AppSec listener
- **THEN** the outbound request `User-Agent` is `Crowdsec-Bouncer-Traefik-Plugin/v9.9.9-test`

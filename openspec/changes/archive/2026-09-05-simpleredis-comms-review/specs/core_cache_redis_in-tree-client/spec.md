## Purpose

The plugin Redis cache uses an in-tree copy of the pooled SimpleRedis client from simpleredis PR #8, not the published v1.0.12 module.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Close stops new dials
After `Close`, `Get`/`MGet`/`Set`/`Del` SHALL return `redis:unreachable` and MUST NOT open a new TCP connection. In-flight commands on a borrowed socket MAY finish; `release` MUST close that socket instead of returning it to the idle list. `Close` SHALL remain safe to call more than once.

#### Scenario: Get after Close does not accept a second connection
- **WHEN** a test client has completed one `Get` (one accept) and then `Close`
- **THEN** a following `Get` returns `redis:unreachable` and the fake server's accept count stays 1

### Requirement: Handshake and idle behaviour are tested
`pkg/simpleredis` tests SHALL cover: AUTH sent once per new dial (not before every command); SELECT sent once per new dial when a database is set; I/O deadline maps to `redis:timeout`; an idle connection older than the idle timeout is closed on the next borrow and a new dial is used.

#### Scenario: AUTH is not repeated on a reused connection
- **WHEN** `Init` is given a password and two sequential `Get`s reuse one connection
- **THEN** the fake server records one AUTH and two GETs

#### Scenario: Silent peer hits the I/O deadline
- **WHEN** a listener accepts and never replies
- **THEN** `Get` returns `redis:timeout`

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: One action covers 500, unreachable, and unreadable body
`CrowdsecAppsecFailureAction` SHALL apply to: AppSec HTTP 500; transport failure or HTTP 502/503/504; and an unreadable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 body on a method that would have sent a body. `ban` SHALL drop the request. `passthrough` on 500 or unreachable SHALL continue as allow (then `next`). `passthrough` on unreadable body SHALL keep today’s headers-only GET to AppSec. `captcha` SHALL use the configured captcha client (`pkg/captcha`), not AppSec JSON `action: captcha`. HTTP 502, 503, and 504 from the AppSec listener SHALL be unreachable (same fallback as a transport failure), not a generic non-200 ban.

#### Scenario: Unreachable passthrough
- **WHEN** AppSec is unreachable and `crowdsecAppsecFailureAction` is `passthrough`
- **THEN** the request proceeds to `next`

#### Scenario: Unreachable ban
- **WHEN** AppSec is unreachable and `crowdsecAppsecFailureAction` is `ban`
- **THEN** the client is forbidden with `ReasonAPPSEC`

#### Scenario: Reverse-proxy HTTP 502, 503, or 504 passthrough
- **WHEN** the AppSec listener returns HTTP 502, 503, or 504 and `crowdsecAppsecFailureAction` is `passthrough`
- **THEN** the request proceeds to `next` (same as transport unreachable)

#### Scenario: Reverse-proxy HTTP 502, 503, or 504 ban
- **WHEN** the AppSec listener returns HTTP 502, 503, or 504 and `crowdsecAppsecFailureAction` is `ban`
- **THEN** the client is forbidden with `ReasonAPPSEC`

#### Scenario: Unreadable body passthrough still queries AppSec
- **WHEN** the request body cannot be buffered, the method has a body, and `crowdsecAppsecFailureAction` is `passthrough`
- **THEN** AppSec is queried with headers only (GET) and the original body is not dropped

#### Scenario: Unreadable body ban
- **WHEN** the request body cannot be buffered, the method has a body, and `crowdsecAppsecFailureAction` is `ban`
- **THEN** the request is dropped without calling origin

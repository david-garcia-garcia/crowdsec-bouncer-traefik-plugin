## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: LAPI lives in package lapi
`package lapi` SHALL own the reclaim value for CrowdSec LAPI/CAPI decisions. The exported type SHALL be `Client`. The package MUST NOT import `pkg/appsec` and MUST NOT export AppSec query, envelope, or AppSec HTTP-client types. Callers SHALL import `pkg/lapi` for `Prepare`, `New`, `OpenStream`, `OpenLive`, `Client`, `LiveLookup`, `Key`, `IdentityHex`, `SessionKey`, and usage-metrics increments.

#### Scenario: Bouncer looks up decisions on lapi
- **WHEN** `pkg/bouncer` compiles against this package
- **THEN** `lapi.Client.LiveLookup` resolves
- **AND** `AppsecQuery` is not a method on `lapi.Client`

### Requirement: LAPI named files stay job-owned
`package lapi` SHALL keep `Client` construct/close in `client.go` and SHALL place stream ticker, live lookup, LAPI/CAPI HTTP, and metrics in `client_stream.go`, `client_live.go`, `client_http.go`, and `client_metrics.go` respectively. Reclaim identity SHALL stay in `identity.go`. Stream store/delete and live decision parse SHALL stay in `client_decisions.go`.

#### Scenario: Named LAPI files exist
- **WHEN** a developer opens `pkg/lapi/`
- **THEN** `client_stream.go`, `client_live.go`, `client_http.go`, and `client_metrics.go` exist
- **AND** `LiveLookup` is declared in `client_live.go`
- **AND** `pkg/lapi/connection_appsec.go` does not exist

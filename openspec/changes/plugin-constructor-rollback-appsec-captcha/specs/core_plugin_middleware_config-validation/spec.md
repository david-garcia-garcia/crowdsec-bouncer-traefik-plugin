## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Appsec mode without AppSec warns and still starts
`crowdsecMode: appsec` with `crowdsecAppsecEnabled: false` selects no decision source and no WAF leg, so the middleware enforces nothing. `ValidateParams` SHALL log a warning for that combination and SHALL still accept the configuration. It MUST NOT return an error, and it MUST NOT imply `crowdsecAppsecEnabled` on (`crowdsecAppsecHost` defaults to `crowdsec:7422` and `crowdsecAppsecFailureAction` defaults to `ban`, so implying it would ban every request on that router against a listener that may not exist). The warning SHALL be emitted at `WARN`, so it is visible at the default log level, and SHALL name both keys and say that no request is checked in this state.

#### Scenario: Appsec mode with AppSec disabled
- **WHEN** `crowdsecMode` is `appsec` and `crowdsecAppsecEnabled` is false
- **THEN** `ValidateParams` returns no error
- **AND** it logs a `WARN` naming `crowdsecMode` and `crowdsecAppsecEnabled` and stating that nothing is enforced

#### Scenario: Appsec mode with AppSec enabled is silent
- **WHEN** `crowdsecMode` is `appsec` and `crowdsecAppsecEnabled` is true
- **THEN** `ValidateParams` logs no such warning
